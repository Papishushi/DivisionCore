# Division Core
Division is an approach in object based coding, applied to videogames and interactive content.
It is developed in C++, with a personal aim to make it CLI for .NET/C#.
Division is inspired by Unity Core tools, but unlike Unity it's source code is completely open source so you can freely modify it and take the most advantage of these tools.
