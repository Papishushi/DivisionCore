# Division Core
Division is an approach in object based coding, applied to videogames and interactive content. It is developed in C++, with a personal aim to make it CLI for .NET/C#.
It is inspired in Unity Core tools, but unlike Unity source code Division it's completely open source so you can freely modify it and take the most use of these tools.
