# Division Core
Division is an approach in object based coding, applied to videogames and interactive content. Giving you a growing array of tools in continious development to create your own scripts.

This set of tools is developed in C++, with a personal aim to make it CLI for .NET/C#.
Division is inspired by Unity Core tools, but unlike Unity it's source code is completely open source so you can freely modify it and take the most advantage of these tools. I declare I have nothing to do with Unity, as I'm not employed or have any kind of links nor bad intentions with the development of this project. I'm just a guy trying to contribute to the creation of more open source developments.

If you have experience programming, you might want to dive into the [Scripting API Reference](https://github.com/Papishushi/DivisionCore/wiki/).
